<h2>Statistical Power</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment"><strong>Definition of Statistical Power</strong>
<ul>
<li class="fragment">Statistical power is the probability that a test will correctly reject a false null hypothesis (i.e., detect an effect when there is one).</li>
<li class="fragment">It is usually denotes as <span class="math inline">\(1-\beta\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> is the Type II error rate ( the probability of failing to reject a false null hypothesis).</li>
</ul></li>
<li class="fragment"><strong>Importance of Statistical Power</strong>
<ul>
<li class="fragment">High power reduces the risk of Type II errors.</li>
<li class="fragment">Ensures that studies are capable of detecting meaningful effects.</li>
<li class="fragment">Important for the credibility and reliability of research findings.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="factors-affecting-statistical-power-12" class="slide level2">
<h2>Factors Affecting Statistical Power (1/2)</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment"><strong>Sample Size</strong>
<ul>
<li class="fragment">Larger sample sizes increase power.</li>
<li class="fragment">Practical considerations: resources, time, and feasibility.</li>
</ul></li>
<li class="fragment"><strong>Effect Size</strong>
<ul>
<li class="fragment">Larger effect sizes are easier to detect, leading to higher power.</li>
<li class="fragment">Different effect sizes exist for different types of analyses. Many of them can be converted between each other. <a href="https://www.escal.site/" data-preview-link="true">(Effect size converter)</a></li>

<section id="factors-affecting-statistical-power-22" class="slide level2">
<h2>Factors Affecting Statistical Power (2/2)</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment"><strong>Significance Level (</strong><span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>)
<ul>
<li class="fragment">Commonly set at 0.05, but lower alpha values (e.g., 0.01) reduce power.</li>
<li class="fragment">Trade-off between Type I error (false positive) and Type II error (false negative).</li>
</ul></li>
<li class="fragment"><strong>Variance</strong>
<ul>
<li class="fragment">Lower variance within data increases power.</li>
<li class="fragment">Methods to reduce variance include controlling for confounding variables and improving measurement precision.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="power-analysis-12" class="slide level2">
<h2>Power Analysis (1/2)</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment"><strong>Purpose of Power Analysis</strong>
<ul>
<li class="fragment">Determine the sample size needed to achieve a desired power level for detecting a given effect size.</li>
<li class="fragment">Can be conducted before (a priori) or after (post hoc) a study.</li>
</ul></li>
<li class="fragment"><strong>Steps in Conducting Power Analysis</strong>
<ul>
<li class="fragment">Define the significance level (α).</li>
<li class="fragment">Estimate the effect size (based on literature or pilot studies).</li>
<li class="fragment">Choose the desired power level (traditionally 80%, more recently: 90% or 95%).</li>
<li class="fragment">Whenever possible, use power analysis tools/software (e.g., G*Power, R) to calculate the required sample size (much easier).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="power-analyses-22" class="slide level2">
<h2>Power Analyses (2/2)</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment"><strong>Types of Power Analysis</strong>
<ul>
<li class="fragment"><em>A priori</em>: Conducted before data collection to ensure adequate sample size.</li>
<li class="fragment"><em>Post hoc</em>: Conducted after the study to determine the achieved power, often used for interpreting non-significant results.</li>
<li class="fragment"><em>Sensitivity analysis</em>: Determines the smallest effect size that can be detected with a given sample size and power.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="power-analyses-and-simulations" class="slide level2">
<h2>Power Analyses and Simulations</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment"><p>Not every power analysis requires simulations</p></li>
<li class="fragment"><p>For simple cases like t-tests, ANOVAs, correlations, multiple regressions, etc. there are <strong>analytical</strong> solutions for calculating power analyses (e.g., <a href="https://www.psychologie.hhu.de/arbeitsgruppen/allgemeine-psychologie-und-arbeitspsychologie/gpower" data-preview-link="true">G*Power</a>)</p></li>
<li class="fragment"><p>For more complex study designs, analytical solutions are difficult or impossible (e.g., situations with multiple interacting factors, non-standard distributions or assumptions, missing data…)</p></li>
<li class="fragment"><p>Focus on <strong>multi-level models</strong>: analytical solutions for power analyses are too complex (or have not even been derived yet).<br>
→ <strong>Simulations</strong></p></li>

<h1>Excursus: Multi-Level Models</h1>

</section>
<section id="multi-level-models-14" class="slide level2">
<h2>Multi-Level Models (1/4)</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment"><p>Alternative Terms</p>
<ul>
<li class="fragment">Multi-level models = hierarchical linear models (HLM) = mixed-effects models</li>
<li class="fragment">Multi-level models ≠ hierarchical regression</li>
</ul></li>
<li class="fragment"><p><strong>Multi-level models have superior power (over, e.g., t-test with data aggregated over trials) when analyzing data that has a nested or hierarchical structure.</strong></p></li>
<li class="fragment"><p>These models account for the fact that data points within groups are often more similar to each other than to data points in other groups.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="multi-level-models-24" class="slide level2">
<h2>Multi-Level Models (2/4)</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment">Benefits
<ul>
<li class="fragment"><strong>Correct Standard Errors:</strong> Multi-level models account for the non-independence of observations within clusters, providing more accurate standard errors and significance tests.</li>
<li class="fragment"><strong>Partitioning Variance:</strong> They allow for the partitioning of variance at different levels (e.g., variance between individuals, within individuals, between trials, …), helping to identify where variability in the outcome lies.</li>
<li class="fragment"><strong>Modeling Complex Relationships:</strong> These models can include fixed effects (constant, average effect of an explanatory variable on the outcome) and random effects (account for variability across different levels in the data).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="multi-level-models-34" class="slide level2">
<h2>Multi-Level Models (3/4)</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment">Typical examples in psychology:
<ul>
<li class="fragment"><p>Nested data structures: Students nested within schools (educational psychology, clinical psychology, cultural differences research, etc.)</p></li>
<li class="fragment"><p>Repeated measures: Participants complete multiple trials which differ in some attributes.<br>
E.g., participants complete 25 trials which differ in the combination of bonus and carbon outcomes.</p></li>
