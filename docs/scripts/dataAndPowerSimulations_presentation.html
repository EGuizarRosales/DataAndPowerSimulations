<h2>Statistical Power</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment"><strong>Definition of Statistical Power</strong>
<ul>
<li class="fragment">Statistical power is the probability that a test will correctly reject a false null hypothesis (i.e., detect an effect when there is one).</li>
<li class="fragment">It is usually denotes as <span class="math inline">\(1-\beta\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> is the Type II error rate ( the probability of failing to reject a false null hypothesis).</li>
</ul></li>
<li class="fragment"><strong>Importance of Statistical Power</strong>
<ul>
<li class="fragment">High power reduces the risk of Type II errors.</li>
<li class="fragment">Ensures that studies are capable of detecting meaningful effects.</li>
<li class="fragment">Important for the credibility and reliability of research findings.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="factors-affecting-statistical-power-12" class="slide level2">
<h2>Factors Affecting Statistical Power (1/2)</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment"><strong>Sample Size</strong>
<ul>
<li class="fragment">Larger sample sizes increase power.</li>
<li class="fragment">Practical considerations: resources, time, and feasibility.</li>
</ul></li>
<li class="fragment"><strong>Effect Size</strong>
<ul>
<li class="fragment">Larger effect sizes are easier to detect, leading to higher power.</li>
<li class="fragment">Different effect sizes exist for different types of analyses. Many of them can be converted between each other. <a href="https://www.escal.site/" data-preview-link="true">(Effect size converter)</a></li>
</ul></li>

</section>
<section id="factors-affecting-statistical-power-22" class="slide level2">
<h2>Factors Affecting Statistical Power (2/2)</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment"><strong>Significance Level (</strong><span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>)
<ul>
<li class="fragment">Commonly set at 0.05, but lower alpha values (e.g., 0.01) reduce power.</li>
<li class="fragment">Trade-off between Type I error (false positive) and Type II error (false negative).</li>
</ul></li>
<li class="fragment"><strong>Variance</strong>
<ul>
<li class="fragment">Lower variance within data increases power.</li>
<li class="fragment">Methods to reduce variance include controlling for confounding variables and improving measurement precision.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="power-analysis-12" class="slide level2">
<h2>Power Analysis (1/2)</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment"><strong>Purpose of Power Analysis</strong>
<ul>
<li class="fragment">Determine the sample size needed to achieve a desired power level for detecting a given effect size.</li>
<li class="fragment">Can be conducted before (a priori) or after (post hoc) a study.</li>
</ul></li>
<li class="fragment"><strong>Steps in Conducting Power Analysis</strong>
<ul>
<li class="fragment">Define the significance level (α).</li>
<li class="fragment">Estimate the effect size (based on literature or pilot studies).</li>
<li class="fragment">Choose the desired power level (traditionally 80%, more recently: 90% or 95%).</li>
<li class="fragment">Whenever possible, use power analysis tools/software (e.g., G*Power, R) to calculate the required sample size (much easier).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="power-analyses-22" class="slide level2">
<h2>Power Analyses (2/2)</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment"><strong>Types of Power Analysis</strong>
<ul>
<li class="fragment"><em>A priori</em>: Conducted before data collection to ensure adequate sample size.</li>
<li class="fragment"><em>Post hoc</em>: Conducted after the study to determine the achieved power, often used for interpreting non-significant results.</li>
<li class="fragment"><em>Sensitivity analysis</em>: Determines the smallest effect size that can be detected with a given sample size and power.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="power-analyses-and-simulations" class="slide level2">
<h2>Power Analyses and Simulations</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment"><p>Not every power analysis requires simulations</p></li>
<li class="fragment"><p>For simple cases like t-tests, ANOVAs, correlations, multiple regressions, etc. there are <strong>analytical</strong> solutions for calculating power analyses (e.g., <a href="https://www.psychologie.hhu.de/arbeitsgruppen/allgemeine-psychologie-und-arbeitspsychologie/gpower" data-preview-link="true">G*Power</a>)</p></li>
<li class="fragment"><p>For more complex study designs, analytical solutions are difficult or impossible (e.g., situations with multiple interacting factors, non-standard distributions or assumptions, missing data…)</p></li>
<li class="fragment"><p>Focus on <strong>multi-level models</strong>: analytical solutions for power analyses are too complex (or have not even been derived yet).<br>
→ <strong>Simulations</strong></p></li>

<h1>Excursus: Multi-Level Models</h1>

</section>
<section id="multi-level-models-14" class="slide level2">
<h2>Multi-Level Models (1/4)</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment"><p>Alternative Terms</p>
<ul>
<li class="fragment">Multi-level models = hierarchical linear models (HLM) = mixed-effects models</li>
<li class="fragment">Multi-level models ≠ hierarchical regression</li>
</ul></li>
<li class="fragment"><p><strong>Multi-level models have superior power (over, e.g., t-test with data aggregated over trials) when analyzing data that has a nested or hierarchical structure.</strong></p></li>
<li class="fragment"><p>These models account for the fact that data points within groups are often more similar to each other than to data points in other groups.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="multi-level-models-24" class="slide level2">
<h2>Multi-Level Models (2/4)</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment">Benefits
<ul>
<li class="fragment"><strong>Correct Standard Errors:</strong> Multi-level models account for the non-independence of observations within clusters, providing more accurate standard errors and significance tests.</li>
<li class="fragment"><strong>Partitioning Variance:</strong> They allow for the partitioning of variance at different levels (e.g., variance between individuals, within individuals, between trials, …), helping to identify where variability in the outcome lies.</li>
<li class="fragment"><strong>Modeling Complex Relationships:</strong> These models can include fixed effects (constant, average effect of an explanatory variable on the outcome) and random effects (account for variability across different levels in the data).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="multi-level-models-34" class="slide level2">
<h2>Multi-Level Models (3/4)</h2>
<ul>
<li class="fragment">Typical examples in psychology:
<ul>
<li class="fragment"><p>Nested data structures: Students nested within schools (educational psychology, clinical psychology, cultural differences research, etc.)</p></li>
<li class="fragment"><p>Repeated measures: Participants complete multiple trials which differ in some attributes.<br>
E.g., participants complete 25 trials which differ in the combination of bonus and carbon outcomes.</p></li>

<h2>Data Simulation: Explanation (3/3)</h2>
<p>In the results panel, the left table displays results of a mixed-model that was fitted with <code>lmer(dwellTime ~ polOri + (1|subj) + (1|trial), data)</code>. The right table displays results of a simple linear regression <code>lm(dwellTime ~ polOri, data_aggregated)</code>. Note that <code>data_aggregated</code> contains for each subject one dwell time aggregated over all trials. Also note that this analysis is equivalent to a simple t-test (with equal variances).</p>

<section id="simr-1" class="slide level2">
<h2><code>simr</code></h2>
<p><code>simr</code> is a package that allows to conduct power simulations for mixed models. It works both for <em>a priori</em> power simulations <strong>without</strong> pilot data as well as (and even better) for <em>a priori</em> power simulations <strong>with</strong> pilot data.</p>
<p>The <strong>advantages</strong> of <code>simr</code> are that it is easier to use than doing power simulations yourself and it makes it also easy to generate power curves. Additionally, it is somewhat more optimized for efficient code execution.</p>
<p>The <strong>disadvantages</strong> of <code>simr</code> are that it less flexibel than your ifinitely customizable data and power simulations. It can also be less efficient in some respects. For instance, you only can only simulate power for one effect of your model at once (while we can save all effects of a model in one simulation in our custom simulations).</p>
<p>My recommendation: If you have pilot data, use <code>simr</code>. If you do not, do your own simulations.</p>
